Modern Presidents Word Guess Game
Developer: Douglas C. Mueller
This is a hangman style game with a modern president theme.  It is written in javascript with a jquery library.  To play, guess a letter on your keypad.  If you guess incorrectly 10 times, you lose.
issues:
- If there are 2 of the same letter in the answer, adds 2 to the available guesses.
- Images of presidents are not showing up in github.
- I can join the blanks so it shows "_ _ _ _ _", but it messes up the logic, so i left the blank as "_,_,_,_,_".
- I want to have a soundbite for each president as the player wins, but i can't link the mp3.
- Audio controls show up on my local version, and it won't auto-play -- but the github version has the controls hidden, and does start auto-play.
- I can't reset the game without browser refresh, if I could, I would add wins/losses.
